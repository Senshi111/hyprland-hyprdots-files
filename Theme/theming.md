## Theme Structure

To create/add new theme (for ex. `My-Fav-Theme`), here are the files configured to theme the base [applications](#theming-applications)

> **Note**
>
> The theme name `My-Fav-Theme` should be consistent for all config file name

```shell
~/.config/
    |
    +--> hypr/themes/
    |   |
    |   +--> My-Fav-Theme.conf
    |
    +--> kitty/themes/
    |   |
    |   +--> My-Fav-Theme.conf
    |
    +--> Kvantum/My-Fav-Theme/
    |   |
    |   +--> My-Fav-Theme.kvconfig
    |   +--> My-Fav-Theme.svg
    |
    +--> qt5ct/colors/
    |   |
    |   +--> My-Fav-Theme.conf
    |
    +--> rofi/themes/
    |   |
    |   +--> My-Fav-Theme.rasi
    |
    +--> swww/
    |   |
    |   +--> wall.ctl   # main control file
    |   +--> My-Fav-Theme/*   # place wallpapers here
    |
    +--> waybar/themes/
        |
        +--> My-Fav-Theme.css

~/.icons/

    +--> My-Fav-Theme/   # main theme for GTK apps
```


## Theming Applications

These are the applications currently supported by the `themeswitch.sh` script
- [gtk apps](#gtk-apps)
- [qt apps](#qt-apps)
- [hypr](#hypr)
- [waybar](#waybar)
- [kitty](#kitty)
- [rofi](#rofi)
- [flatpak](#flatpak)
- [swww](#swww)
- [wlogout](#wlogout)


### GTK apps

Download GTK3/4 themes and extract it to `~/.themes/My-Fav-Theme`.   
Themes are available in https://www.gnome-look.org/browse?cat=135&ord=rating.   
You can also make your own gtk theme if you have time!   


### QT apps

For QT5 apps, the plasma style is themed by `kvantum` and its color scheme is handled by `qt5ct`.   
Copy the corresponding config file from any existing theme and modify the color codes in file `~/.config/Kvantum/My-Fav-Theme/My-Fav-Theme.kvconfig` and use vector tool like inkscape to alter color in `~/.config/Kvantum/My-Fav-Theme/My-Fav-Theme.svg`.   
Alter the same color codes in `~/.config/qt5ct/colors/My-Fav-Theme.conf` as well.   
Please keep all the colors consistent with the corresponding GTK theme.   


### Hypr

The global theme settings are configured in `~/.config/hypr/themes/My-Fav-Theme.conf`, this file sets the,
- general hyprland settings like,
    - gaps
    - borders
    - border colors
    - window layout
- cursor theme and size
- gtk theme and icons
- kavantum theme
- fonts (gtk)


### Waybar

#### Waybar Style
Copy the corresponding config file from any existing theme and modify the color codes in file `~/.config/waybar/themes/My-Fav-Theme.css`. Please keep all the colors consistent with the corresponding GTK and QT theme.   
This style will be refreshed by `wbarstylegen.sh` script when you change the theme. It adapts to the border and font size set in `~/.config/hypr/themes/My-Fav-Theme.conf`   

> **Note**
>
> if the rounding value is 0 in hyprland theme, it will override the rounded corners set in waybar style

#### Waybar Config
the waybar config can also be dynamically changed/cycled by `wbarconfgen.sh` script.   

```shell
❯ cd ~/.config/waybar
❯ ./wbarconfgen.sh n   # to set next mode
❯ ./wbarconfgen.sh p   # to set previous mode
```

It reads the control file `~/.config/waybar/config.ctl` and generates corresponding `~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc`   
So you can create your preferred config by adding entries to this file as,   

```shell
❯ cat ~/.config/waybar/config.ctl
1|28|bottom|( cpu memory ) ( clock )|wlr/workspaces hyprland/window|( network bluetooth pulseaudio custom/updates ) ( tray ) ( custom/wallchange custom/mode custom/wbar custom/cliphist custom/power )
0|0|top|( wlr/workspaces hyprland/window )|( clock )|( cpu memory ) ( network bluetooth pulseaudio custom/updates ) ( tray ) ( custom/wallchange custom/mode custom/wbar custom/cliphist custom/power )
0||bottom|[ custom/power custom/cliphist custom/wbar custom/mode custom/wallchange ] [ wlr/workspaces ]|[ clock ]|[ network bluetooth pulseaudio ] [ tray ]
```
where `|` is the delimiter and column,
1. is `0` or `1`, where `1` indicates the current mode in use
2. is to set height of the bar (leave it empty `<blank>` to auto-scale for 3% of monitor res), the font size adapts to this height value.
3. is postition of bar top/bottom
4. is the left modules
5. is the center modules
6. is the right modules

Here in col 4, 5 and 6 use `(` and `)` to group modules as a pill or `{` and `}` to group it as a rounded box or `[` and `]` to group it as a box   

> **Note**
>
> Each module in col 4, 5 and 6 should be separated by space and corresponding module file `~/.config/waybar/modules/<module>.jsonc` should be created.   
> If the module name has `/`, then only use the last field after `/` as file name, ex. `custom/mode` should have corresponding `~/.config/waybar/modules/mode.jsonc` file.   


### Kitty

Copy the corresponding config file from any existing theme and modify the color codes in file `~/.config/kitty/themes/My-Fav-Theme.conf`   
Please keep all the colors consistent with the corresponding GTK and QT theme.   


### Rofi

Copy the corresponding config file from any existing theme and modify the color codes in file `~/.config/rofi/themes/My-Fav-Theme.rasi`   
Please keep all the colors consistent with the corresponding GTK and QT theme.   


### Flatpak

Flatpaks automatically picks the gtk theme set in `~/.config/hypr/themes/My-Fav-Theme.conf`, so no configuration is required.   
Also please note, Flatpak QT apps currently does not support theming.   


### Swww

Place all the wallpapers (should be valid image files or animated gif files) matching the theme in a folder for example `~/.config/swww/My-Fav-Theme/*`.   
Then add any one of the wallpaper filename (with path) in the `|` delimited control file `~/.config/swww/wall.ctl` as shown here,   

```shell
❯ cat ~/.config/swww/wall.ctl
1|Catppuccin-Mocha|~/.config/swww/Catppuccin-Mocha/forest_dark_winter.jpg
0|Catppuccin-Latte|~/.config/swww/Catppuccin-Latte/jormungandr.jpg
0|Decay-Green|~/.config/swww/Decay-Green/moments_before_desk.png
0|My-Fav-Theme|<image file with full path>
```
where column,
1. is `0` or `1`, where `1` indicates the current theme in use
2. is the theme name `My-Fav-Theme`
3. is the Dir/Wallpaper to be used for `My-Fav-Theme`

The `swwwallpaper.sh` script is used to cycle through all the wallpapers in the directory, it also automatically updates (column 3) this control file with the current wallpaper used.   

```shell
❯ cd ~/.config/swww
❯ ./swwwallpaper.sh -n   # to set next wallpaper
❯ ./swwwallpaper.sh -p   # to set previous wallpaper
```
> **Note**
>
> Please add this theme/wallpaper entry in `wall.ctl` file only after all [these](#theme-structure) theme files are configured.


### Wlogout

To add you own logout style create corresding `~/.config/wlogout/layout_<n>` and `~/.config/wlogout/style_<n>` file, use existing `layout_1` and `style_1` as a reference.   
Its is launched by `~/.config/hypr/scripts/logoutlaunch.sh <n>` script, where `<n>` is your style number.   
Here the colors and border-radius is auto detected from current hypr theme.   


## Theme Switch

All themes configured in your system is controlled using `themeswitch.sh` script.   
It loops through all the themes (column 2) listed in the control file `~/.config/swww/wall.ctl` and applies it to the supported apps.   

```shell
❯ cd ~/.config/hypr/scripts
❯ ./themeswitch.sh -n   # to set next theme
❯ ./themeswitch.sh -p   # to set previous theme
❯ ./themeswitch.sh -s My-Fav-Theme   # to set My-Fav-Theme
```


## Theme Select

The `themeselect.sh` script can be used to launch a rofi menu for selecting and applying a theme from the list of available themes.   
This list source themes from `~/.config/swww/wall.ctl` and triggers `themeswitch.sh` script to apply it.   
Thumbnails used in this rofi theme select menu can be refresed based on the current wallpapers linked to its corresponding theme.   

```shell
❯ cd ~/.config/hypr/scripts
❯ ./themeselect.sh   # launch theme select menu
❯ ./themeselect.sh T   # refresh thumbnails for theme select menu
```
